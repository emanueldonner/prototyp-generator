# Prototype Generator

Prototype Generator is a web application that allows users to drag and drop different components to create website prototypes. The components include patterns, templates, and collections.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop**: Prototype Generator allows users to easily drag and drop components to create their own prototype websites.
- **Searchable Components**: Users can search for specific components in the component library.
- **Preview**: As components are dragged onto the build area, a preview is shown to indicate where the component will be placed.

## Getting Started

```

Then, navigate into the cloned repository and install the necessary dependencies:
